We do not sell your data and we do not share it with third parties for marketing.
<br><br>

<h2>3. Legal basis (EU / Switzerland)</h2>
<br>
If you are located in the EU or Switzerland, we process your data based on:
<br>
Contract – to provide you with the App and its functions

You can withdraw your consent at any time in the app settings or on your device.
